### Sr Fullstack Software Engineer ⚙️

### Hello World 👋

I'm Jorge or George for non-spanish speakers (se habla español). Started coding at 12, till... now? +15 years of experience in the industry, I just simply love what I do.

Started as a freelancer, worked for corporates and then switched to startups. I really like to create and solve real world problemas, no BS example projects, I work on real things (but of course I love MVPs!).
